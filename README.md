# Welcome to LibreriaPlus!

A lightweight library to survive the first year of Mupltiplatform Development Superior Vocational Degree!

## What does it include?

It's divided by different utils. Here you are the whole list:

- `MenuPlus`: Perfect for creating console menus. It handles all kind of exceptions and wrong inputs by the user. Creating a new option is as easy as adding a key-value pair to a map. Key is the title and value is a consumer that handles the thing. The consumer expects a Scanner as param, due technical issues.
- `ScannerPlus`: A scanner-provided static class that provides lots of bullet-proof methods for getting input data from the user.
- `NumerosPlus`: A library to work with numbers. Random, and things like that (currently, only random and random array).

> Disclaimer: this library is made by a Java noob. I've been programming in JS during some years, but Idk if that made me a good programmer.
